# About

## Our Vision: Open, Efficient, and Community-Driven

The Workflow Orchestrator (WFO) programme provides an easy-to-use workflow
application, supporting software, samples and documentation for automating and
orchestrating order, administration and provisioning processes.

## Core Principles of WFO

  - Open Source and Community-Driven – developed by and for the NREN community,
    but also adopted by organisations beyond it.
  - User-Friendly and Modular – lightweight, opinionated, and easy to integrate
    into existing systems.
  - Sustainability and Continuity – working towards a self-sustaining
    organisation to maintain and enhance the core software.
  - Support and Collaboration – encouraging adoption and supporting the
    community through documentation, workshops, and best practices.

## Governance and project documentation

The Workflow Orchestrator programme has been established under [The 
Commons Conservancy](https://commonsconservancy.org/programmes/) 
foundation and runs its own [governance](https://dracc.commonsconservancy.org/0040/). 

Several projects with code, examples and documentation have been defined
and are available [here](https://workfloworchestrator.org/).
