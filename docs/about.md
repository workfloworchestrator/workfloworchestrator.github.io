# About
The purpose of the Workflow Orchestrator programme is to provide an
easy-to-use set of tools, samples and documentation for automating 
and orchestrating order, administration and provisioning processes.
The programme was started to facilitate worldwide collaboration in 
the field of (network) automation and orchestration, by sharing code, 
knowledge, examples and ideas. 
<br><br>
The Workflow Orchestrator programme has been established under [The 
Commons Conservancy](https://commonsconservancy.org/programmes/) 
foundation and runs its own [governance](https://dracc.commonsconservancy.org/0040/). 

Several projects with code, examples and documentation have been defined
and are available [here](https://workfloworchestrator.org/).
